fullTitle: Using a discord.js Bot Project to Learn TypeScript
blurb: I've always learned best with hands-on projects with practical applications for my professional work or personal hobbies. A community I am a part of had a need for a fairly robust Discord bot, which was the perfect opportunity for me to hone my JavaScript skills and finally learn TypeScript. This also provided an opportunity to further hone my relational database design skills, which is always fun and exciting for me!
